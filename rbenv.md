# rbenv

## Details about our rbenv installation

rbenv is installed locally at /l/local/rbenv.  /l/local/rbenv/bin should already be in your shell's $PATH.
rbenv can be used to switch ruby versions.

## Picking a local ruby environment (using rbenv)

* Current production ruby is JRuby-1.7x*
* List available ruby versions (JRuby and MRI) with `rbenv versions`
* Choose a ruby version to use with `rbenv shell <full_version_string>` (e.g, `rbenv shell jruby-1.7.15`)

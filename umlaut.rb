Umlaut could be called an 'open source front-end for a link resolver' -- Umlaut accepts requests in OpenURL format, but has no knowledge base of it's own, it can be used as a front-end for an existing knowledge base. (Currently SFX, but other plugins can be written). 

Umlaut can be retrieved from [github](https://github.com/team-umlaut/umlaut/wiki).  Web systems will have to write a plugin for that, but we don't expect to do a lot of heavy ruby/rails coding changes here.  The umlaut maintainers made some efforts to make things easily upgradeable/maintainable and still overideable locally.  

Web Systems does not currently have a timeline for this project, but I think our interest is to begin in Fall 2012.

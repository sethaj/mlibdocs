Maybe move this under hosting?
Scenario:  We want to run an off-the-shelf application that is not jruby or ruby 1.9 or rails 3.0 compatible.

We can prototype it in MRI/C-ruby. But we'll have trouble moving to production for a lot of reasons.

Compatibility:

Can we try jruby-lint ?
Using c-libraries?

Versioning:

Do we have versions/gems that we know won't work on production?

Hosting:

If it has to be put in production what will the options be?


Timelines:

We have to know that prototypes may not necessarily run on production.  We may need to have service conversations, we may need to have community conversations.

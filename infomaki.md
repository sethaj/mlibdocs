Infomaki is tool for gathering usability feedback from web users in a low-impact manner.
It's available as [a sourceforge project](http://sourceforge.net/projects/infomaki/).

The UX department asked Web Systems to implement this some years ago; we told them no because it was rails and nothing we did runs rails.  Well, that's about to change.  We don't have a timeline for deploying this.  For the most part we expect this to be used internally, though there may be some use external as well.

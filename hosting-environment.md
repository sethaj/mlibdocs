## Dev Servers
Some comment here? Maybe we don't need this section, but I think something more needs to be said.

----
All software packages listed here (as well as [Gems](gems.md)?) are installed/maintained by Core Services. These will be kept up to date, generally to the most current stable version. Keeping around legacy versions will be explicitly avoided, don't count on them.

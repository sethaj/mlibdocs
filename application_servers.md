# MLibrary Ruby Development

### Application Servers

* Current production uses JRuby + Torquebox.
  * Torquebox is short on support right now, and we aren't java developers.
  * JRuby is a little behind right now, both for ruby in general and for rails specifically.
* Future production is being evaluated.
  * Will probably have support for ruby/jruby + application server specified in your gemfile.
